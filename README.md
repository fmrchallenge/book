Introduction to Formal Methods for Robotics
===========================================

Abstract
--------

This book provides a concise, self-contained introduction to topics usually
regarded as formal methods for robotics.  We assume the reader has background
knowledge broadly associated with robotics research, e.g., of classical (linear)
control theory, elementary graph search methods, and propositional (Boolean)
logic.
